    <h1>Description</h1>
    <nav>
        Retro Racer is a game that incorporates elements from many different racing games 
        into a new retrowave themed package. This is a project that is currently being worked 
        on for my multiplayer games systems class. I'm working with a team of four and doing my 
        best to work as the project lead.

    <h2>Learning Unity</h2>
    <p>
      This was my first time using Unity or any game engine for that matter, besides learning 
      through tutorials and such. This was also my first time using github for version control 
      between multiple people which was super helpful once we got it up and working.

    <h2>The Design Process</h2>
    <p>
        The design process for this game was a lot of inpiration from other games and brainstorming
         on whiteboards and in notepads to get a better idea of what the game would look like. This 
         helped us to set up a clear plan on how best to complete the game.

    <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Although the project isn't quite finished I've learned a ton about working with and managing 
        a development team as well as working with Unity in combination with github for version control. 
        This project has also already taught me a ton about the game design process with how hands on 
        and open ended it has been.
